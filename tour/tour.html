            <p>Clear that if you're going to a Weeknd concert, he's got a show for you to remember, and a night you'll
                never forget. Favorite parts of the concert beyond hearing my jams were when you would see very real,
                sincere happiness from Abel come across his face based on how insane the crowd could go, and how clearly
                so many of the thousands of people there love the work he's created. I imagine for a pop star, that is
                the true ideal, to know you're not only where you are because you've given people a good time, but that
                your music and you yourself have made a difference in the lives of an immeasurable amount of people. Not
                an all-timer concert film in any regard, but I didn't need it to be. I got his music, I got his
                aesthetic, and I got The Weeknd himself. I can save my tears.</p>

            <p>Just a voice that distinctly resembles Michael Jackson on MDMA. It’s crazy to see him evolve into a
                mega-popstar. I would’ve never guessed it. The entire R&B genre woke its ass up when The Weeknd arrived
                onto the scene.</p>
